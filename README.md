# Dot-Files
A place to store dot files so I can easily transfer configurations between systems. Inspired by [gotgenes/shell-configs](https://github.com/gotgenes/shell-configs).

## How it Works
This project uses symbolic links to create dot files in the home directory. To use, simply invoke the `link-files.sh` script.
